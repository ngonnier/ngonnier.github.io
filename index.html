I'm a PhD student in computer science at LORIA, Nancy, France.
I'm interested in self-organization and complex systems.

I'm currently doing my PhD under the supervision of Hervé Frezza Buet and Yann Boniface. 
The thesis is entitled : "CxSOM : towards a non-hierarchical architecture of self-organizing maps"
</p>
<p>
The cerebral cortex appears in numerous studies as an architecture of learning modules, the cortical areas, which interact retroactively. This bio-inspired notion of modular architecture has a computational interest in the search for new unsupervised learning paradigms. These are indeed complex systems that are favourable to the emergence of learning mechanisms resulting from the interaction between the modules.
Based on this biological inspiration, we explore non-hierarchical architectures of self-organizing maps.
Self-organizing maps (SOMs) are a well known unsupervised learning algorithm that creates a low-dimensional and spatially ordered representation of any input space.
In this work, we develop a modified model of self-organizing maps, CxSOM (Consensus Driven Multi-SOM), which enables the creation of non-hierarchical architectures of several SOMs that learn from each other.
We showed that the model was able to complete associative memory tasks, learning on data from different modalities. 
The aim is to learn a representation of several input spaces within the architecture and at the same time extract and reuse the relationships existing between these inputs.
